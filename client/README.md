# SkillMentor

**Concept**:
SkillMentor is a social application that aims to bridge the generation gap by connecting experienced professionals (mentors) with younger individuals (mentees) who are looking to advance their careers or gain guidance in specific fields. The app facilitates mentorship and knowledge sharing across industries and expertise areas.

**Key Features**:

1. **Mentor-Mentee Matching**: Users create profiles indicating whether they are mentors or mentees and specify their areas of expertise or the skills they want to develop. The app then suggests suitable mentor-mentee pairs.

2. **Messaging and Video Calls**: SkillMentor includes a messaging platform and video call integration to facilitate communication between mentors and mentees, allowing for virtual mentorship sessions.

3. **Goal Setting**: Mentees can set career goals or objectives, and mentors can help them create action plans to achieve those goals. The app tracks progress over time.

4. **Resource Sharing**: Mentors can share articles, videos, books, and other educational resources with their mentees to support their learning and growth.

5. **Skill Assessment**: SkillMentor offers tools for mentors to assess the skill levels of their mentees and provide feedback and recommendations for improvement.

6. **Mentorship Forums**: The app includes discussion forums where users can engage in group discussions, seek advice, and share experiences related to mentorship and career development.

7. **Profile Verification**: Users can opt for profile verification to establish trust and credibility within the mentorship community.

8. **Feedback and Ratings**: Both mentors and mentees can leave feedback and ratings after mentorship sessions to ensure quality interactions and continuous improvement.
